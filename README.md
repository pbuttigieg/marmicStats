### Description
Welcome to the Statistics I code repository for the IMPRS Marine Microbiology MarMic programme. Here, you will find R code used in our practical sessions to reinforce the content of the morning lectures. While some exercises are provided, these are meant more as a guideline for some self-directed practice: students are encouraged to play around with the functions and parameters to gain a hands-on understanding of some of the key points in the lecture material.

**Note that students will *not* be asked to reproduce any R-specific knowledge in the exam**. The content of these practicals is only meant to provide some active learning and, as a positive side-effect, introduce students to some aspects of R. Here, R is not taught in a very step-by-step manner, but in a task-directed way, so it may  feel that learners are thrown in the deep end; however, students are given individual support during three afternoons of guided practical sessions. Many great beginner's guides to R are available elsewhere, for example [here](http://www.r-bloggers.com/r-tutorial-series-r-beginners-guide-and-r-bloggers-updates/), [here](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/r-tutorial-for-beginners-a-quick-start-up-kit), [here](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/files/scicomp/Dloads/RProgramming/BestFirstRTutorial.pdf), [here](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/08/google-video-r-tutorials.html), and [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf). Check them all out and see which one has a style and scope that is most useful to you!

### Questions?
If you are a MarMic student and have questions or spot any bugs, please create a GitHub account (if you don't already have one) and post an issue in this repository (click the encircled exclamation mark in the tabs on the right, or click [here](https://github.com/pbuttigieg/marmicStats/issues). You can also contact the IoR or current tutor via e-mail, but posting issues is cooler.
